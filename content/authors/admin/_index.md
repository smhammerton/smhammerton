I am graduate student working towards an MS in Epidemiology & Biostatistics (emphasis in Epidemiology) and Graduate Certificate in Infectious Disease Epidemiology. I expect to graduate in May of 2022 and being a PhD in June! While this degree will also be in Epidemiology & Biostatistics, my emphasis will now be in data analysis and modeling. I have particular interest and research emphasis in infectious diseases. I am passionate about “real world” implications of public health research and practice on individuals and context‐aware data analytic approaches to answering epidemiological questions.
